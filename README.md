ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Dieudonne, a full-stack developer with a passion for building cool, user-friendly web applications and diving deep into the world of AI & machine learning. Whether itâ€™s crafting sleek *"**React & Next.js frontends"***, engineering solid *"**Node.js and Flask backends**"*, or *"**training AI models**"*, I love bringing ideas to life with code. Currently, Iâ€™m leveling up my AI game while pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Pisa. ðŸš€

Iâ€™ve built some exciting projects like *"**ClassTap**"*, an RFID-powered student attendance system, *"**KiitEats**"*, a food ordering platform that makes cravings disappear, and many more. When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me exploring the latest tech trends, tweaking my Tailwind CSS designs, or figuring out why my code worked five minutes ago but suddenly doesnâ€™t. ðŸ¤¯

Letâ€™s connect, collab, and build something awesome together! Find me at *https://dieudonnei.vercel.app* or slide into my DM on LinkedIn: *https://www.linkedin.com/in/iyabivuze/* . ðŸ’¬âœ¨
